        <h2>Train Status FAQ</h2>
           <p>Q) What is Live Train Running Status?</p>
           <p> A) Live train running status for Indian railway trains means the
             current location of any train and its real time delay status. 
             It also includes estimated arrival time of the train at upcoming stops.</p><br>
            
            
           <p>Q) How can we check Live Train Status on RailYatri?</p>
            <p>A) RailYatri started this easy-to-use app feature to 
            simplify train travel for all its users. Now train status can 
            be checked on the go via RailYatri mobile app or website to
             know the current location of the train and its delay status.
              Check train status through any modern day Internet-powered devices. 
              If you are on a train you can also check live train status being 
              offline by switching to GPS mode for fetching live train status. 
              RailYatri recommends its users to use GPS mode while travelling on 
              train for faster and more precise location.</p><br>
            
            
            <p> Q) What is the source for Live Train Status for RailYatri?
                <p> A) In general, RailYatri is a full-stack information and booking 
                    platform. Specifically, on running train status, RailYatri has the
                     most frequent and real-time updates of train location. RailYatri 
                     collects train location data in a crowd-sourced manner from the 
                     GPS or Cell-Tower network of mobile phones of its users. Thus this 
                     data is more precise and real-time. We recommend our users to use 
                     the RailYatri app which also works offline if the user is enroute 
                     journey. In summary, RailYatri’s source of data is crowdsourced
                      status shared by users who are on the train.</p><br>
            
            
                    <p>Q) What is offline Live Train Status? How does it work?</p>
                        <p>A) Offline live train status means that no internet connection
                             is required to find the live train status and ETA of train at
                              the upcoming station. This needs the one-time download of the
                               time table or the route on the user’s phone. Post that if 
                               the user is on a train then he can find the exact location 
                               of the train and track the ETA in offline mode as well. 
                               This feature is very useful since railway tracks do not 
                               always have full network coverage. Hence, we recommend our
                                users to use the RailYatri app for hassle-free travel.</p><br>
            
            
                            <p> Q) How is RailYatri’s Live Train Status updates more accurate 
                                than the traditional Indian railway model?</p>
                                <p> A) The running status updates on mobile provided by RailYatri a
                                    pp are much more accurate as it is derived from mobile GPS or 
                                    Cell-tower of the devices shared by our users. The traditional
                                     Indian railway model for train running status depends on the 
                                     updates from the last stop, which is delayed and prone to manual errors.</p><br>
            

            
                                    <p>Q) Why do users need to check current train running status frequently
                                         on the date of the journey?</p>
                                        <p>A) It is critical to save on time while waiting to board your
                                             train or booking a taxi when you reach your destination. 
                                             Train running status updates every minute. So, we recommend
                                              that our users check the status updates from time to time. 
                                              The train running status information becomes more and more 
                                              accurate, as the train is about to reach the estimated time 
                                              of travel. This information helps you save time and plan better!</p><br>
            
            
                                            <p>Q) How is delay or on-time information calculated for a running train?</p>
                                                <p> A) Indian Railways measures the delay or on-time information of a train,
                                                     basis estimated time of arrival(ETA) at the next stop. We follow the same
                                                      analogy. So as an example if you see that a train is running late by 30 
                                                      minutes at RailYatri, it means that the train is estimated to reach delayed
                                                       by 30 minutes on its next arriving station. However, it can cover up this
                                                        delay on the remainder of stations. Thus, we recommend our users to look 
                                                        at the estimated time of arrival(ETA) at all upcoming stops and also to 
                                                        check train running status from time to time.</p><br>
            
            
                                                    <p>Q) What is ETA according to the Indian railway? How does RailYatri calculate ETA?</p>
                                                        <p>A) ETA is an Estimated Time of Arrival of a train at upcoming stations. 
                                                            RailYatri has the best ETA prediction as compared to any other website 
                                                            or application. RailYatri uses machine learning algorithms to predict 
                                                            the ETA-based on the historical running patterns associated with the train.
                                                             Trains do recover time too. So the train delay at the upcoming stoppages 
                                                             may be less than what has been reported from the last station. We recommend
                                                              you to plan accordingly using the RailYatri app.</p>
